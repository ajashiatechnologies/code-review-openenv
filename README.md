# 🔍 Code Review OpenEnv

**A real-world AI agent evaluation environment for automated code review tasks.**

Built by **Ajashia Techno Wizards** for the Meta × Scaler OpenEnv Hackathon.

## Problem Statement

Every software company depends on code reviews to catch bugs, security vulnerabilities,
and performance problems before they reach production. But evaluating how well an AI
agent performs code review is hard — there is no standard benchmark, no graded
difficulty progression, and no structured reward signal.

This environment fills that gap. It models the real pull-request review workflow
and lets any LLM agent be benchmarked on a three-level task progression from
basic issue detection to full professional review generation.

---

## Environment Overview

An AI agent connects to this environment, receives a realistic code diff, and must:

1. **Detect** the type of issue present (bug, security, performance, style, or none)
2. **Classify** the severity considering module criticality and context
3. **Write** a professional code review comment with concrete fix suggestions

The environment grades every action with a structured reward signal and supports
multi-step episodes, session isolation, and multi-file context diffs.

---

## Observation Space

Each observation returned by `/reset` and `/step` contains:

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `session_id` | string | Unique episode identifier (UUID) |
| `diff` | string | The code diff to review |
| `language` | string | Programming language (python, java, javascript, go) |
| `file_name` | string | Source file name (e.g. `auth.py`, `UserService.java`) |
| `context` | string | Module context (e.g. `authentication module`) |
| `additional_files` | list[string] | Related context files for multi-file diffs |
| `history` | list[string] | Previous actions taken in this episode |
| `step_num` | int | Current step number (0-indexed) |
| `max_steps` | int | Maximum steps per episode (5) |

---

## Action Space

| Field | Type | Values |
|---|---|---|
| `action_type` | string | `detect` \| `classify` \| `review` |
| `issue_types` | list[string] | `bug` \| `security` \| `performance` \| `style` \| `none` |
| `severity` | string | `critical` \| `high` \| `medium` \| `low` |
| `line_numbers` | list[int] | Line numbers flagged (optional) |
| `comment` | string | Full review comment text (required for `review` action) |

---

## Tasks

### Easy — Issue Detection
Detect the type(s) of issue present in the code diff.

- **Required action:** `detect` with `issue_types`
- **Grading:** Jaccard similarity between predicted and correct issue sets
- **Scoring:** 1.0 exact match, 0.4–0.9 partial, -0.1 false negative, -0.2 false positive
- **Success threshold:** 0.70
- **Max steps:** 3

### Medium — Severity Classification
Classify the severity of the detected issue considering module criticality.

- **Required action:** `classify` with `severity`
- **Grading:** Distance on 4-level severity scale (critical > high > medium > low)
- **Scoring:** 1.0 exact, 0.7 one step off, 0.4 two steps off; -0.2 penalty for under-classifying critical modules
- **Success threshold:** 0.80
- **Max steps:** 5

### Hard — Full Code Review
Multi-step pipeline: detect → classify → write a professional review comment.

- **Required actions:** `detect`, then `classify`, then `review`
- **Grading:** 7-criterion rubric (see below)
- **Success threshold:** 0.55
- **Max steps:** 5

#### Hard Task Rubric

| Criterion | Weight | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Preparation bonus | 0.15 | Detect + classify completed before review |
| Word count | 0.10 | ≥ 60 words |
| Issue mention | 0.20 | Names every detected issue type |
| Severity mention | 0.10 | Uses the exact severity word |
| Technical keywords | 0.20 | Covers required domain terms (e.g. SQL injection, O(n²)) |
| Concrete fix | 0.15 | Uses replace/avoid/refactor/sanitize language |
| Professional tone | 0.10 | Uses recommend/suggest/consider |

Anti-gaming guard: keyword-stuffing detection (>15% issue-type density) caps the score at 0.05.

## Example Scenario

```python
query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = '" + name + "'"
for i in range(len(data)):
    for j in range(len(data)):
        process(data[i], data[j])
```

### Expected AI Behavior:

* Detect: SQL Injection (Security)
* Detect: Nested Loop (Performance)
* Assign Severity: Critical
* Suggest Fix: Use parameterized queries

---

## Evaluation Strategy

The environment ensures:

* Correct answers → High reward
* Partial answers → Moderate reward
* Incorrect answers → Low/negative reward

---

## Baseline Agent

We provide a simple agent (`inference.py`) that:

* Interacts with the environment
* Produces baseline scores
* Demonstrates environment functionality

---

## How to Run

### 1. Start Environment

```bash
uvicorn env.environment:app --reload
```

### 2. Run Agent

```bash
python inference.py
```

---

## Docker Support

```bash
docker build -t code-review-env .
docker run -p 7860:7860 code-review-env
```

---

## API Endpoints

| Endpoint    | Description       |
| ----------- | ----------------- |
| POST /reset | Start new episode |
| POST /step  | Perform action    |
| GET /state  | Get current state |
| GET /health | Health check      |
